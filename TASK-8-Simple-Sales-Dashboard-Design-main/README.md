# Task 8 – Simple Sales Dashboard

## Overview
This project is part of my data analytics task to build an **interactive sales dashboard** using Power BI.<br>
The dashboard visualizes sales performance over time, across regions, and by product categories, and includes key business KPIs.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Power BI Desktop** – for data cleaning, modeling, and visualization.<br>
- **Microsoft Excel** – for initial data review (optional, before importing into Power BI).<br>

## What I Did
1. **Loaded the dataset** into Power BI.<br>
2. Changed data types<br>
3. Created calculated columns and measures:<br>
   - `MonthYear` and `MonthSort` for chronological ordering.<br>
   - `Total Sales`, `Total Profit`, and `Profit %` as KPIs.<br>
4. Built visuals:<br>
   - **Line Chart** – Sales by MonthYear.<br>
   - **Bar Chart** – Sales by Region.<br>
   - **Donut Chart** – Sales by Category.<br>
5. Added a **Region slicer** for interactivity.<br>
6. Formatted visuals (titles, labels, currency, and colors).<br>
7. Displayed **three KPI Cards** at the top for quick business overview.<br>
8. Wrote **key insights** from the dashboard.
